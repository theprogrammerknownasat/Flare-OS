# Flare-OS

Flare OS is an open scorce os designed for the raspberry pi pico.

It outputs to a ssd1306 display through pins 4(sda) and 5(scl)

It requires this display and also:

 - A potentiometer on pin 26

 - A pushbuton on pin 10

  - A mini buzer on pan 20

 - And a GP11 sensor on pin 11
 
 All pin numbers are marked by GP
 
 (Update)
 Robotistan PicoBricks seems to have all of the moduals that you would need already hooked up to the correct spots.
